        You might be asking “what is AngularJS anyway?” AngularJS is a javascript library that provides tools for
        writing rich browser applications. Even though there are a seemingly endless number of articles about the
        different components of AngularJS, the basics of Angular can be broken down into 5 major components:
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Directives</li>
        <li>Controllers</li>
        <li>Scopes</li>
        <li>Services</li>
        <li>Dependency Injection</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        The angular way of developing applications dictates that we take care of the data and angular will take care of
        the DOM manipulation.
